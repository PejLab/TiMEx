\title{Stability of mutually exclusive groups in breast cancer}
\format{\code{breastSubsampling} is a list with as many elements as 
subsampling frequencies provided (3 in this case). Each element is further 
a list with as many elements as number of sizes of the significantly 
mutually exclusive groups identified. Additionally, \code{bonf} and 
\code{fdr} are two lists corresponding to each of these elements, 
representing different multiple correction methods. Finally, each element 
is a vector of relative counts of the significantly mutually exclusive 
groups identified. For example, \code{breastSubsampling[[1]][[3]]} 
represents the relative counts of the identified mutually exclusive groups 
of size 3 for a subsampling frequency of 30\%, for both  \code{fdr} and 
\code{bonf} (bonferroni) multiple correction methods.}
