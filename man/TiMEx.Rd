\usage{
TiMEx(mat, pairMu, pairPvalue, groupPvalue)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{binary alteration matrix, with rows representing patients and
columns representing genes}

\item{pairMu}{pair-level threshold on mu (real number between 0 and 1).
Default is 0.5.}

\item{pairPvalue}{pair-level threshold on p-value (real number between 0
and 1). Default is 0.01.}

\item{groupPvalue}{threshold for the corrected p-value, lower than which
cliques are significant. Default to 0.1}
}
\value{
list consisting of:
\itemize{
\item{\code{genesSignif}} {list of significantly mutually exclusive groups,
as gene names, sorted by corrected p-value. The list contains as many
elements as identified lengths of groups. For example,
\code{genesSignif[[2]]} is a list containing the gene names of the
significant groups of size 2. Each list of this type further has two
elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf}, corresponding to different multiple
testing correction methods. Each element is a matrix, in which rows
represent gene names of significantly mutually exclusive groups.}

\item{\code{idxSignif}} {list of significantly mutually exclusive groups,
as indices in the input matrix, sorted by corrected p-value. The list
contains  as many elements as identified lengths of groups. For example,
\code{idxSignif[[2]]} is a list containing the indices of the
significant groups of size 2. Each list of this type further has two
elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf}, corresponding to different multiple
testing correction methods. Each element is a matrix, in which rows
represent indices of significantly mutually exclusive groups.}

\item{\code{pvals}} {list of corrected significant p-values corresponding to
the tested cliques, ordered ascendingly. The list contains as many elements
as identified lengths of significant groups. For example, \code{pvals[[2]]}
is a list containing the p-values of the significant maximal cliques of
size 2. Each list of this type further has two elements, \code{fdr} and
\code{bonf}, corresponding to different multiple testing correction
methods. Each element is a vector, of length the number of significant
maximal cliques of a given size.}

\item{\code{posSignif}} {list of positions of the significant groups in the
input list of maximal cliques, ordered ascendingly by corrected p-value.
The list contains as many elements as identified lengths of significant
groups. For example, \code{posSignif[[2]]} is a list containing the
positions of the significant groups of size 2.  Each list of this type
further has two elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf}, corresponding to
different multiple correction methods.  Each element is a vector, of
length the number of significant maximal cliques of a given size.}

\item{\code{MusGroup}} {list of inferred mu values corresponding to
the tested cliques, ordered ascendingly by the corresponding corrected
p-value. The list contains as many elements as identified lengths of
significant groups. For example, \code{MusGroup[[2]]} is a list containing
the mu values of the significant maximal cliques of size 2. Each list of
this type further has two elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf},
corresponding to different multiple testing correction methods. Each
element is a vector, of length the number of significant maximal cliques of
a given size.}

\item{\code{mcStruct}} {input structure of maximal cliques to be tested
for mutual exclusivity, as returned by \code{\link{doMaxCliques}}.}

\item{\code{matrix}} {input binary alteration matrix.}

\item{\code{groupPvalue}} {input threshold for the corrected p-value, lower
than which cliques are significant.}

\description{
\code{TiMEx} is the main function of this package. It
identifies all groups of mutually exclusive cancer alterations in a large
binary input dataset.
}
\details{
Dependning on the size of the dataset (both in terms of samples
and alterations), TiMEx can require a reasonable time to run. For example,
the approximate running time is 10 minutes for the
\code{\link{ovarian.rda}} cancer dataset, and 45 minutes for the
\code{\link{breast.rda}} cancer  dataset included in this package, on a
personal computer.

\code{TiMEx} displays progress messages. In a fist step, it indicates
the gene which is currently being tested against the remaining genes. In a
later step, it indicates the size of the clique currently being tested,
and the number of cliques to test.
