\title{Stability of mutually exclusive groups in the glioblastoma datased used
by Dendrix}
\format{\code{gbmDendrixSubsampling} is a list with as many elements as
subsampling frequencies provided (3 in this case). Each element is further
a list with as many elemenets as number of sizes of the significantly
mutually exclusive groups identified. Aditionally, \code{bonf} and
\code{fdr} are two lists corresponding to each of these elements,
representing different multiple correction methods. Finally, each element
is a vector of relative counts of the significantly mutually exclusive
groups identified. For example, \code{gbmDendrixSubsampling[[1]][[3]]}
represents the relative counts of the identified mutually exclusive groups
of size 3 for a subsampling frequency of 30\%, for both  \code{fdr} and
\code{bonf} (bonferroni) multiple correction methods.}

Produced with the function \code{\link{subsampleAnalysis}}, ran with
the inputs \code{subsampl<-c(0.3,0.5,0.8)}, \code{noReps<-100}, and the
mutually exclusive groups from \code{\link{gbmDendrixOutput}}.

\description{
Dataset containing the stability of the mutually exclusive groups identified
by TiMEx in the glioblastoma dataset \code{\link{gbmDendrix}}, used by
Leiserson \emph{et. al} in "Simultaneous identification of multiple driver
pathways in cancer" (Plos Computational Biology, 2013), after subsampling
the set of patients at frequencies of \code{30\%}, \code{50\%}, and
\code{80\%}, for 100 times.
