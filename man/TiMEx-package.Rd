\title{TiMEx: A package for finding mutually exclusive groups of alterations in
large cancer datasets}
\description{
The main function of this package is \code{\link{TiMEx}}, which receives as
an input a binary matrix representing the dataset. Optionally,
significance levels for edge-based thresholds (\code{pairMu} and
\code{pairPvalue}) and a q-value cutoff (\code{groupPvalue}) can also
be provided, overriding the default values. Alternatively, the users
interested in running separately the three steps of the TiMEx procedure
should access, in this order, the functions \code{\link{analyzePairs}},
\code{\link{doMaxCliques}}, and \code{\link{findSignifCliques}}.
}
\details{
Moreover, this package provides functions to pre-process the input data
(\code{\link{doMetagene}},\code{\link{removeLowFreqs}}), to post-process the
resulting groups (\code{\link{produceTableSignifGroups}},
\code{\link{subsampleAnalysis}}, \code{plotGroupByName},
\code{\link{recoverAllNamesGroups}}), as well as to simulate a dataset
generated from the TiMEx model (\code{\link{simulatedGenes}}).

Multiple datasets are available within this package.
\code{\link{gbmDendrix.rda}} is a glioblastoma dataset used by ... in ...,
\code{\link{breast.rda}} and \code{\link{ovarian.rda}} are datasets
downloaded from the cBio Portal and preprocessed as explained in.
