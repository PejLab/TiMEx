\title{Metagroups of genes in ovarian cancer}
\format{\code{ovarianGroups} is a list with 263 elements, where each
element is a vector of genes with identical alteration patterns as the
current gene. The numbers indicate the positions of the genes in the input
matrix.}

\description{
Dataset containing the genes with identical alteration patterns in the
ovarian cancer dataset \code{\link{ovarian.rda}} (before preprocessing). It
is represented as a list of metagenes, with as many elements as input
genes which had an identical alteration pattern with at least one other
input gene.
