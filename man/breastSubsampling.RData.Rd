\title{Stability of mutually exclusive groups in breast cancer}
\format{\code{noRepsBreast} is the number of repetitions  and
\code{countsAllBreast} is  a list with as many elements as subsampling
frequencies provided (3 in this case). Each element is further a list with
as many elemenets as number of sizes of the significantly mutually
exclusive groups identified. Aditionally, \code{bonf} and \code{fdr} are
two lists corresponding to each of these elements, representing different
multiple correction methods. Finally, each element is a vector of relative
counts of the significantly mutually exclusive groups identified. For
example, \code{countsAllBreast[[1]][[3]]} represents the relative counts of
the identified mutually exclusive groups of size 3 for a subsampling
frequency of 30\%, for both  \code{fdr} and \code{bonf} (bonferroni)
multiple correction methods.}

Produced with the function \code{\link{subsampleAnalysis}}, ran with
the inputs \code{subsampl<-c(0.3,0.5,0.8)}, \code{noReps<-100}, and the
mutually exclusive groups from \code{\link{breastOutput.rda}}.

\description{
Dataset containing the stability of the mutually exclusive groups identified
by TiMEx in the breast cancer dataset \code{\link{breast.rda}}, after
subsampling the set of patients at frequencies of \code{30\%},
\code{50\%}, and \code{80\%}, for 100 times.
