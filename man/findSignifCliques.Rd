\title{Tests all maximal cliques for mutual exclusivity}
\usage{
findSignifCliques(mat, mcStruct, groupPvalue)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{binary alteration matrix, with rows representing patients and
columns representing genes}

\item{mcStruct}{list containing maximal cliques, as returned by
\code{\link{doMaxCliques}}}

\item{groupPvalue}{threshold for the corrected p-value of the groups, lower
than which cliques are significant (real number between 0 and 1). Default
is 0.1.}
}
\value{
list consisting of:
\itemize{
\item{\code{genesSignif}} {list of significantly mutually exclusive groups,
as gene names, sorted by corrected p-value. The list contains as many
elements as identified lengths of groups. For example,
\code{genesSignif[[2]]}
is a list containing the gene names of the significant groups of size 2.
Each list of this type further has two elements, \code{fdr} and
\code{bonf}, corresponding to different multiple testing correction
methods. Each element is a matrix, in which rows represent gene names of
significantly mutually exclusive groups.}

\item{\code{idxSignif}} {list of significantly mutually exclusive groups, as
indices in the input matrix, sorted by corrected p-value. The list
contains as many elements as identified lengths of groups. For example,
\code{idxSignif[[2]]} is a list containing the indices of the
significant groups of size 2. Each list of this type further has two
elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf}, corresponding to different multiple
testing correction methods. Each element is a matrix, in which rows
represent indices of significantly mutually exclusive groups.}

\item{\code{pvals}} {list of corrected significant p-values corresponding to
the tested cliques, ordered ascendingly. The list contains as many elements
as identified lengths of significant groups. For example, \code{pvals[[2]]}
is a list containing the p-values of the significant maximal cliques of
size 2. Each list of this type further has two elements, \code{fdr} and
\code{bonf}, corresponding to different multiple testing correction
methods. Each element is a vector, of length the number of significant
maximal cliques of a given size.}

\item{\code{posSignif}} {list of positions of the significant groups in the
input list of maximal cliques, ordered ascendingly by corrected p-value.
The list contains as many elements as identified lengths of significant
groups. For example, \code{posSignif[[2]]} is a list containing the
positions of the significant groups of size 2.  Each list of this type
further has two elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf}, corresponding to
different multiple correction methods.  Each element is a vector, of length
the number of significant maximal cliques of a given size.}

\item{\code{MusGroup}} {list of inferred mu values corresponding to
the tested cliques, ordered ascendingly by the corresponding corrected
p-value. The list contains as many elements as identified lengths of
significant groups. For example, \code{MusGroup[[2]]} is a list containing
the mu values of the significant maximal cliques of size 2. Each list of
this type further has two elements, \code{fdr} and \code{bonf},
corresponding to different multiple testing correction methods. Each
element is a vector, of length the number of significant maximal cliques
of a given size.}

\item{\code{mcStruct}} {input structure of maximal cliques to be tested
for mutual exclusivity, as returned by \code{\link{doMaxCliques}}}

\item{\code{matrix}} {input binary alteration matrix}

\item{\code{groupPvalue}} {input threshold for the corrected p-value, lower
than which cliques are significant}
}
}
\description{
\code{findSignifCliques} performs step 3 of the TiMEx
procedure, namely tests all candidate maximal cliques for mutual
exclusivity and reports the significant ones.
}
\details{
This function displays progress messages, namely the size of the
clique currently being tested, and the number of cliques to test.

Note that sequentially performing steps 1, 2, and 3 of the TiMEx procedure
(functions \code{\link{analyzePairs}}, \code{\link{doMaxCliques}}, and
\code{\link{findSignifCliques}}) is equivalent to simply running the
function \code{\link{TiMEx}}.

\examples{
# First, test all pairs from the ovarian dataset for mutual exclusivity
# (takes approximately 5 minutes).
data(ovarian)
\donttest{ovarianPairs<-analyzePairs(ovarian)}

# Second, identify all maximal cliques using the default thresholds
\donttest{ovarianMaxCliques<-doMaxCliques(ovarianPairs)}

# Then, test all maximal cliques for mutual exclusivity and report the
# significant ones, based on a corrected p-value threshold of 0.1 (default).
\donttest{ovarianMEgroups<-findSignifCliques(ovarian,ovarianMaxCliques)}
