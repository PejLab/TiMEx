#' @description The main usages of TiMEx, a package for finding mutually 
#' exclusive groups of alterations in large cancer datasets.
#'
#'
#' @section Overview:
#'The most important function in this package is \code{\link{TiMEx}}, which 
#'identifies all mutually exclusive groups in a binary dataset. TiMEx is a 
#'procedure implementing three steps: first, all pairs in the input dataset 
#'are tested for mutual exclusivity. Second, maximal cliques are identified 
#'on the basis of a selected number of pairs. Third, the resulting cliques 
#'are tested for mutual exclusivity. Additional inputs to \code{\link{TiMEx}} 
#'include thresholds on the significance and intensity of the mutually
#'exclusive pairs (\code{pairMu} and \code{pairPvalue}) and q-value cutoff 
#'on the mutually exclusive groups (\code{groupPvalue}). Unless otherwise 
#'specified, \code{\link{TiMEx}} will use the default values of these inputs. 
#'
#'Alternatively, users interested in running separately the three steps of 
#'the TiMEx procedure should run the functions \code{\link{analyzePairs}},
#'\code{\link{doMaxCliques}}, and \code{\link{findSignifCliques}} 
#'(sequentially and in this order).
#'
#'
#'@section Preprocessing and postprocessing:
#'This package also provides functions to preprocess the input data
#'(\code{\link{doMetagene}}, \code{\link{removeLowFreqs}}), as well as to 
#'postprocess the identified mutually exclusive groups 
#'(\code{\link{produceTablesSignifGroups}}, 
#'\code{\link{subsampleAnalysis}}, \code{\link{plotGroupByName}}, 
#'\code{\link{recoverAllNamesGroups}}). 
#'
#'
#' @section Datasets:
#' Multiple datasets are available within this package. 
#' \code{\link{breast}} and \code{\link{ovarian}} are datasets 
#' downloaded from cBioPortal (TCGA) in July 2014, and preprocessed as 
#' explained in "TiMEx: A Waiting Time Model For Mutually Exclusive Cancer 
#' Alterations", by Constantinescu et al. (Bioinformatics, 2015). 
#' \code{\link{gbmDendrix}} is a glioblastoma dataset used by
#' Leiserson \emph{et. al} in "Simultaneous identification of multiple driver 
#' pathways in cancer" (Plos Computational Biology, 2013). Additionally, the
#' dataset \code{gbm}, preprocessed by Szczurek \emph{et. al} as explained in 
#' "Modeling mutual exclusivity of cancer mutations" (Research in Computational 
#' Molecular Biology, 2014), and available in the package \code{muex}
#' (\url{ https://www1.ethz.ch/bsse/cbg/software/muex}), was also used in
#' examples in this package.
#' 
#' For each of these four datasets, the identified significantly mutually
#' exclusive groups are available as a separate dataset 
#' (\code{\link{breastOutput}}, \code{\link{ovarianOutput}}, 
#' \code{\link{gbmDendrixOutput}}, and \code{\link{gbmMuexOutput}}). Similarly,
#' results of a subsampling analysis ran with 100 repetitions on the 
#' identified groups are available as separate datasets 
#' (\code{\link{breastSubsampling}}, \code{\link{ovarianSubsampling}},
#' \code{\link{gbmDendrixSubsampling}}, and \code{\link{gbmMuexSubsampling}}). 
#' 
#' In the case of breast and ovarian cancer, the metagroups of genes in the 
#' original datasets (produced with the function \code{\link{doMetagene}}) are
#' available as separate datasets (\code{\link{breastGroups}} and 
#' \code{\link{ovarianGroups}}). 
#' 
#' Finally, the binary input matrices 
#' corresponding to the four breast cancer subtypes "LuminalA", "LuminalB",
#' "Her2", and "Basal" are available in the dataset 
#' \code{\link{breastSubtypes}}, and the significantly mutually exclusive 
#' groups identified in each of these four subtypes are available in the
#' dataset \code{\link{breastSubtypesOutput}}.

#'Datasets can be generated from the TiMEx model using the function 
#'\code{\link{simulateGenes}}.
