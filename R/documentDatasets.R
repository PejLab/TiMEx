#' Stability of mutually exclusive groups in ovarian cancer
#'
#' Dataset containing the stability of the mutually exclusive groups identified
#' by TiMEx in the ovarian cancer dataset \code{\link{ovarian.rda}}, after 
#' subsampling the set of patients at frequencies of \code{30\%}, 
#' \code{50\%}, and \code{80\%}, for 100 times.
#'
#' @format \code{noRepsOvarian} is the number of repetitions  and 
#' \code{countsAllOvarian} is  
#' a list with as many elements as subsampling frequencies provided (3 in this
#' case). Each element is further a list with as many elemenets as number of 
#' sizes of the significantly mutually exclusive groups identified. 
#' Aditionally, \code{bonf} and \code{fdr} are two lists corresponding to 
#' each of these elements, representing different multiple correction 
#' methods. Finally, each element is a vector of relative counts of the 
#' significantly mutually exclusive groups identified. For example, 
#' \code{countsAllOvarian[[1]][[3]]} represents the relative counts of the 
#' identified mutually exclusive groups of size 3 for a subsampling frequency 
#' of 30\%, for both  \code{fdr} and \code{bonf} (bonferroni) multiple 
#' correction methods.
#' 
#' @source Produced with the function \code{\link{subsampleAnalysis}}, ran with
#' the inputs \code{subsampl<-c(0.3,0.5,0.8)}, \code{noReps<-100}, and the
#' mutually exclusive groups from \code{\link{ovarianOutput.rda}}.
